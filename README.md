# SEG2105-MealerApp


This is the repository group project created for SEG 2105 - Introduction to Software Engineering at uOttawa, taken in Fall of 2022.

We created a food-ordering app in Java similar to Skip The Dishes or Uber Eats, in which users could create accounts and order food from
restaurants, while restaurant owners could sell their food and track orders.
