# SEG2105-MealerApp


This is the repository created for a group project done in SEG 2105 - Introduction to Software Engineering at uOttawa, taken in Fall of 2022.

We created a food-ordering app in Java similar to Skip The Dishes or Uber Eats, in which users could create accounts and order food from
restaurants, while restaurant owners could sell their food and track orders.

The database and accounts were handled with Firebase and OAuth, the GUI was designed in Figma and then implemented with XML, and software engineering tools such as UML and class diagrams were used extensively to architect and describe the design of the software system.
